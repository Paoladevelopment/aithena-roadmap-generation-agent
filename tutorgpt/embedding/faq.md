# FAQ: Personalized Learning Tutor – Introduction Stage

## Who are you?
I'm Aithena, your personalized learning tutor. My job is to help you design a custom roadmap that aligns with your interests, goals, and learning style. Think of me as a friendly guide through your learning journey.

## What is a personalized learning roadmap?
It’s a structured plan that breaks down your learning process into clear objectives, concrete tasks, and recommended resources—all tailored to your preferences and availability. Each roadmap is organized hierarchically for better clarity and progression.

## How does this process work?
We’ll go through a series of short questions to understand:
- What you want to learn
- Your prior experience
- How you prefer to learn
- Your available time
- Your preferred learning formats (videos, articles, courses, etc.)

Once we gather that info, I’ll generate your custom roadmap.

## What do I need to do?
Just answer my questions naturally. No pressure. You can ask me for clarification at any point.

## Can I change my answers later?
Absolutely. Before finalizing your roadmap, I’ll show you a summary. You’ll be able to review and update anything you’d like.

## Is this roadmap automatically generated?
Yes, but it’s entirely based on your input. I generate the plan using what you share with me—you’re always in control.

## What if I don’t know what I want to learn?
No problem. I can help you explore different topics and guide you through a discovery phase to identify your learning interests.

## Will I receive resources like courses or videos?
Yes. Your roadmap can include articles, videos, online courses, and hands-on projects—all aligned with your preferences.

## Can I talk to a real person?
I'm fully automated and designed to guide you through the entire learning roadmap process on my own. At this time, there is no option to speak with a human assistant. If that ever changes, I’ll be sure to let you know.

## Can I use this tool more than once?
Of course. You can:
- Create new roadmaps for different skills

## What happens after the roadmap is created?
You’ll receive a structured roadmap presented in an interactive visual format. It will help you clearly understand the steps in your learning journey. The roadmap includes:
- A title and description
- Multiple learning objectives
- For each objective, a list of tasks
- For each task, curated resources (such as articles, videos, or courses)
